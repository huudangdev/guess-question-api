One of the most fundamental concepts in programming is the idea of data types. It’s a concept that is shared near-universally across major programming languages. In short, data types are instructions to a program’s compiler (or interpreter) regarding how it should handle a given value. Considering just how fundamental this idea is to most programming languages, you might think that the behavior of a particular data type in one language would be the same as in another. After all, why should a string in Ruby behave any differently from a string in JavaScript?
Well, for those of you who prefer to keep things simple (like me), I have some bad news: data type behaviors are nuanced and often particular to their own language. And that’s why it’s important that when you’re using a language you have a thorough understanding of it’s quirks, lest you find yourself expecting one set of behaviors and ending up with another. And with that in mind, let’s dive into data types in JavaScript and see if we can figure out their quirks.
